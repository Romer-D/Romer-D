### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Romer. Here's my brief bio:

- I've been working with data for a good 10+ years. Always loved the coding and problem solving aspect of the data world. 
- Global Lead BI resource of a SaaS business that generates $700M sales a year and a search engine that needs no introduction.
- I advise on/and produce business insights and analysis for stakeholders to steer towards meeting KPIs and targets.
- I've mentored and trained BI colleagues in delivering insights to stakeholders from ground up.
- I am always in the middle of an RPG game, taking an online course and reading a book. Right now those are: :video_game: [Elden Ring](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/), :book: [Google Advanced Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics) and :books: [Lives of the Stoics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50484473-lives-of-the-stoics).
