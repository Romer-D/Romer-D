ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Romer. Here's my brief bio:

- I've been working with data for a good 10+ years. Always enjoyed the coding and problem solving aspect of the data world. 
- Global Lead BI resource of a SaaS business that generates $700M sales a year.
- I deliver insights any analysis to stakeholders to steer their business to the right direction.

This is an attempt at collating things I learned over the years in a portfolio format. Questions? Let's connect!
